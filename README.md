[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/npm/postgres-pool/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/npm/postgres-pool)

Connection pool implementation for [pg](https://node-postgres.com/). Compatible with [pg-pool](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-pool) options and syntax.

### Why?

* There were some connection timeout issues that we encountered with pg-pool and the npm was not being updated.
* [Added graceful cluster failover](#handle-cluster-failover-gracefully)
* [Added default AWS TLS settings via `ssl='aws-rds'`](#aws-rds-specific-tls-settings-for-connections)
* Typescript is used to enforce type safety and promises are preferred over callbacks.

## Getting Started

### Simple query (automatically releases connection after query - recommended)

```js
const { Pool } = require('postgres-pool');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: 'postgres://username:pwd@127.0.0.1/db_name',
});

const userId = 42;
const results = await pool.query('SELECT * from "users" where id=$1', [userId]);

console.log('user:', results.rows[0])
```

### Using named parameters in the query

```js
const { Pool } = require('postgres-pool');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: 'postgres://username:pwd@127.0.0.1/db_name',
});

const userId = 42;
const results = await pool.query('SELECT * from "users" where id=@id', {
  id: userId,
});

console.log('user:', results.rows[0])
```

### More control over connections (not recommended)

```js
const { Pool } = require('postgres-pool');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: 'postgres://username:pwd@127.0.0.1/db_name',
});

const userId = 42;
const connection = await pool.connect();
try {
  const results = await connection.query('SELECT * from "users" where id=$1', [userId]);
  console.log('user:', results.rows[0])
} finally {
  // NOTE: You MUST call connection.release() to return the connection back to the pool
  await connection.release();
}
```

### Handle errors from connections in the pool

```js
const { Pool } = require('postgres-pool');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: 'postgres://username:pwd@127.0.0.1/db_name',
});

pool.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Unexpected error on idle client', err);
  process.exit(-1);
});
```

### Graceful shutdown

```js
const { Pool } = require('postgres-pool');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: 'postgres://username:pwd@127.0.0.1/db_name',
});

await pool.end();
```

### Explicit connection details instead of a connection string

```js
const { Pool } = require('postgres-pool');

const pool = new Pool({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  database: 'db_name',
  user: 'foo',
  password: 'bar',
  port: 1234,
});
```

### AWS RDS specific TLS settings for connections
> Setting ssl='aws-rds' will:
> * configure the [AWS root certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html)
> * reject any connection which is not authorized with the list of supplied CAs.
> * attempt to use TLSv1.2 as the minimum TLS version.
>
> It is the same as:
> ```js
> ssl: {
>   rejectUnauthorized: true,
>   ca: fs.readFileSync('./certs/rds-ca-2019-root.pem'),
>   minVersion: 'TLSv1.2',
> }
> ```

```js
const { Pool } = require('postgres-pool');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: 'postgres://username:pwd@127.0.0.1/db_name',
  ssl: 'aws-rds'
});
```

### TLS details for a connection

```js
const { Pool } = require('postgres-pool');

const pool = new Pool({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  database: 'db_name',
  user: 'foo',
  password: 'bar',
  port: 1234,
  ssl: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false,
    ca: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/server-certificates/root.crt').toString(),
    key: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/client-key/postgresql.key').toString(),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/client-certificates/postgresql.crt').toString(),
  }
});
```

### Change size of the pool

```js
const { Pool } = require('postgres-pool');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: 'postgres://username:pwd@127.0.0.1/db_name',
  poolSize: 10, // Default is 10 connections
});
```

### Change retry on error settings

```js
const { Pool } = require('postgres-pool');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: 'postgres://username:pwd@127.0.0.1/db_name',
  retryConnectionMaxRetries: 5, // Number of retries to attempt when there's an error matching `retryConnectionErrorCodes`. A value of 0 will disable connection retry.
  retryConnectionWaitMillis: 100, // Milliseconds to wait between retry connection attempts after receiving a connection error with code that matches `retryConnectionErrorCodes`. A value of 0 will try reconnecting immediately.
  retryConnectionErrorCodes: ['ENOTFOUND', 'EAI_AGAIN'], // Error codes to trigger a connection retry.
});
```

### Change timeout thresholds

```js
const { Pool } = require('postgres-pool');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: 'postgres://username:pwd@127.0.0.1/db_name',
  idleTimeoutMillis: 10000, // Time to keep a connection idle. Default is 10s
  waitForAvailableConnectionTimeoutMillis: 90000, // Time to wait to obtain a connection from the pool. Default is 90s
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 30000, // Max time to connect to postgres. Default is 30s
});
```

### Handle cluster failover gracefully

> When a cluster has a failover event, promoting a read-replica to master, there can be a couple sets of errors that
> happen with already established connections in the pool as well as new connections before
> the cluster is available in a ready state.
>
> By default, when making a new postgres connection and the server throws an error with a message like:
> `the database system is starting up`, the postgres-pool library will attempt to reconnect
> (with no delay between attempts) for a maximum of 90s.
>
> Similarly, if a non-readonly query (create/update/delete/etc) is executed on a readonly connection, the server  will
> throw an error with a message like: `cannot execute UPDATE in a read-only transaction`. This can occur when a
> connection to a db cluster is established and the cluster fails over before the connection is terminated, thus the
> connected server becomes a read-replica instead of the expected master.
> The postgres-pool library will attempt to reconnect (with no delay between attempts) for a maximum of 90s and will
> try to execute the query on the new connection.
>
> Defaults can be overridden and this behavior can be disabled entirely by specifying different values for the
> pool options below:

```js
const { Pool } = require('postgres-pool');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: 'postgres://username:pwd@127.0.0.1/db_name',
  reconnectOnDatabaseIsStartingError: true,         // Enable/disable reconnecting on "the database system is starting up" errors
  waitForDatabaseStartupMillis: 0,                  // Milliseconds to wait between retry connection attempts while the database is starting up
  databaseStartupTimeoutMillis: 90000,              // If connection attempts continually return "the database system is starting up", this is the total number of milliseconds to wait until an error is thrown.
  reconnectOnReadOnlyTransactionError: true,        // If the query should be retried when the database throws "cannot execute X in a read-only transaction"
  waitForReconnectReadOnlyTransactionMillis: 0,     // Milliseconds to wait between retry queries while the connection is marked as read-only
  readOnlyTransactionReconnectTimeoutMillis: 90000, // If queries continually return "cannot execute X in a read-only transaction", this is the total number of milliseconds to wait until an error is thrown
  reconnectOnConnectionError: true,                 // If the query should be retried when the database throws "Client has encountered a connection error and is not queryable"
  waitForReconnectConnectionMillis: 0,              // Milliseconds to wait between retry queries after receiving a connection error
  connectionReconnectTimeoutMillis: 90000,          // If queries continually return "Client has encountered a connection error and is not queryable", this is the total number of milliseconds to wait until an error is thrown
});
```
